# Checker Robot
**Checker Robot** is an advanced system that merges robotics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence to bring the classic board game of checkers to life. Utilizing the TM5-900 robotic arm equipped with a built-in camera, the robot can detect the game board and pieces with precision using OpenCV. It validates moves, strategizes using a game engine powered by AlphaBeta pruning, and executes actions seamlessly through robotic manipulation. 

The system also includes a commentator module driven by Gemini AI, which provides real-time feedback, strategic recommendations, and motivational commentary, enhancing the interactivity and engagement of the game. With its ability to adapt to various board orientations and lighting conditions, **Checker Robot** showcases the potential of robotics in educational and recreational applications. This project demonstrates how advanced robotics can combine perception, decision-making, and physical action to deliver an engaging and immersive gaming experience.
